            "clean_text": "wilmington del ap  a difficult political atmosphere for president joe biden may have become even more treacherous with the acquittal of kyle rittenhousebiden was already facing sliding poll numbers with an electorate worn down by the coronavirus pandemic and increasing inflation now the president finds himself caught between outraged democrats  some of whom were already stewing over bidens inability to land police reform and voting rights legislation  and republicans looking to use the rittenhouse case to exploit the national divide over matters of grievance and racethis is one of the last things biden wants to be engaging in at this moment as he tries to finish up the big build back better bill and get that across the finish line through the senate said christopher borick director of the muhlenberg college institute of public opinion race and kyle rittenhouse is not the space where he wants or needs to be going deep right nowadvertisementthe acquittal of rittenhouse has touched off new conversations about racial justice vigilantism and policing in america the illinois teen armed himself with an ar15style semiautomatic rifle during an august 2020 protest in kenosha wisconsin days after the shooting of a black man by a white police officer he said he came to small city to help protect a car lot from vandals and provide medical aidrittenhouse would end up fatally shooting two men and maiming a third rittenhouse and his lawyers successfully argued that he had acted in selfdefense during a confrontation in which he feared for his lifethe verdict in the case comes at a moment when biden is trying to keep fellow democrats focused on passing his massive social services and climate bill and hoping to turn the tide with americans who have soured on his performance as president the president responded carefully following fridays verdict expressing respect for the jurys decision he later added in a written statement that like many americans he was angry and concerned with the jury acquittal of rittenhouse meanwhile republicans who had success in this months virginia election in part by accusing democrats of promoting critical race theory in public schools are embracing 18yearold rittenhouse as their newest hero in americas culture wars gop reps paul gosar of arizona and matt gaetz of florida have said theyd like to hire him as an intern with gosar suggesting they arm wrestle for the honor another republican rep lauren boebert of colorado on saturday predicted that liberal outrage over the rittenhouse trial would benefit her partyit seems liberals want selfdefense to be illegal boebert tweeted try running on that in 2022 and see how far it gets you with the majority of the sane american publicformer president donald trump was quick to stand with rittenhouse following the verdict he called the teen brave for testifying in his own defense and accused the left of trying to fan hatred with its treatment of rittenhouseadvertisementtrump has spent much of his postpresidency stoking divisions with his frontal criticism of biden and of any republican who has not marched in lockstep with his views and most republicans either through silence or direct endorsement have followed his leadin the aftermath of the acquittal republicans have highlighted a tweet by biden during his winning 2020 presidential campaign in which he appeared to suggest that rittenhouse was a white supremacist the tweet from september 2020 excoriated trump for failing to disavow white supremacists on the debate stage the previous night and included a video that contained a still image of rittenhouse from the night of the kenosha shooting and footage of torchbearing white supremacists at the 2017 unite the right rally in charlottesville virginiasen tom cotton of arkansas and republican national committee chairwoman ronna mcdaniel are among party officials who have called on biden to apologizehe smeared a teenager to score political points and spread lies about this case mcdaniel wrote on twitter what biden did was dangerous and inflammatoryasked by a reporter soon after the verdict if he stood by his campaign social media posting biden responded that i stand by what the jury has concludedborick the muhlenberg college pollster said the results of this months elections in virginia show that driving at cultural issues  including race and transgender rights  could be a good strategy for republicans trying to energize a segment of the electorate that was passionate about trump but less enthusiastic about the rest of the gop but borick warned that the gops fulsome embrace of rittenhouse wasnt without riski dont know if its a great place to be if youre trying come the midterms to reach suburban voters and educated voters who might not fault the decision to acquit rittenhouse because of the circumstances but are far from comfortable holding him up as a hero borick saideven before the verdict biden had been facing increased pressure from some democrats over the lack of progress on passing voting rights and police reform legislationlast month a day after senate republicans filibustered a major voting bill for the second time this year biden acknowledged that the process of governing could be frustrating and sometimes dispiriting but urged supporters to keep the faithat the same civil rights leaders have expressed frustration that biden has not used the power of the bully pulpit more to push for a broad police reform bill named after george floyd the black minneapolis man whose killing last year by police touched off protests around the usspeaking at an event earlier this week where he signed into law a trio of bills to increase aid to police biden only made passing mention of the george floyd act asking legislators from both parties to work together to make it lawthats next biden saidfind aps full coverage on the trial of kyle rittenhouse

partyshe made that abundantly clear in an interview with the new york times over the weekend suggesting that the passage of the infrastructure bill and the house approval of president joe bidens build back better measure are simply not enough to deliver on the expectations voters have for her party and she also aptly diagnosed much of her partys current political problemsglasgow scotland  november 09 alexandria ocasiocortez us representative for new yorks 14th congressional district speaks during an event at the us climate action centre during cop26 on november 9 2021 in glasgow scotland day ten of the 2021 climate summit in glasgow will focus on gender science and innovation this is the 26th conference of the parties and represents a gathering of all the countries signed on to the un framework convention on climate change and the paris climate agreement the aim of this years conference is to commit countries to netzero carbon emissions by 2050 photo by ian forsythgetty images democrats have a trifecta and have been unable to pass votingrights protections said ocasiocortez and so people can wring their hands and say but manchin all they want or but the filibuster all they want but at the end of the day what people see are the results of their actions and the results of investing their timei think thats exactly rightthe average voter likely knows one thing about our current politics democrats are in control of the white house the senate and the house they are far less familiar with the narrowness of the democratic majorities in those two chambers or with the filibuster rules that prevent any legislation from moving forward without 60 votesread morethats not for a lack of trying by biden of course he explicitly made the point about the narrowness of democrats margin in the senate during a cnn townhall late last month when youre in the united states senate and youre president of the united states and you have 50 democrats every one is a president

the list for cnnscnns chris cillizza cuts through the political spin and tells you what you need to know close dialog while there is some broad agreement on the problem facing democrats the party diverges broadly on the solutionthe view of most establishment democrats  including biden and his white house  is that they need to focus more on selling all that they have done to voters i think the white house should do 25 presidential events in the next couple months just on infrastructure said sean patrick maloney the chairman of house democrats campaign arm earlier this month and we should do 1000 congressional events alongside those presidential eventsthat is not the view of ocasiocortez however her belief is not that democrats havent sold their accomplishments well enough but rather that the party has been too timid to push the envelope legislatively in ways that get the partys base excited and engagedi think that if we pass the build back better act as the house passed it that we have a shot to go back to our communities and say we delivered said aoc but thats not to say that this process has not been demoralizing for a lot of folks because there were enormous promises made not just at the beginning and not just during the election but that continued to be made and this is where i have sounded the alarm because what really dampens turnout is when democrats make promises that they dont keepif ocasiocortez is right the next few weeksmonths hold little good for democrats the build back better legislation is certain to be pared down in the senate by the demands of moderate democratic sens joe manchin of west virginia and kyrsten sinema of arizona among others and then it will be sent back to the house for effectively a rubber stamp of approval  a move that seems certain to further alienate aoc and her liberal colleagues from the processadd it up and you get nothing good for democrats as they try to find their footing ahead of the midterm battle for control of congress",

decide that carrying guns  especially militarystyle rifles  is itself a powerful form of protest that can be used to intimidate both their political opponents and officeholderscarrying guns openly is perhaps more than anything else a kind of speech its meant to communicate a clear message i may decide to kill youstory continues below advertisementthe intimidation is the point and some on the right are already suggesting that carrying guns should become a tool of political engagement a way to terrorize the supposedly dangerous left into submissionwe may see it a lot more in the future whenever liberals gather to march in support of abortion rights or to protest police brutality or to advocate for greater health care access they could be met by visibly elaborately armed conservatives fantasizing about becoming the next kyle rittenhouse  or at the very least showing the liberals whos bossafter all what better way is there to own the libs than making a bunch of libs literally fear for their livesopinion kyle rittenhouses 2 million legal funds won his case most defendants cant afford that quality of aidits not as though we havent seen this before in april 2020 protesters converged on the michigan capitol carrying weapons to protest the states emergency measures to stop the spread of covid19 gun advocates have brought weapons to hearings in other state houses as well while no one has yet shot a legislator in a state house the message is clear protesters are saying not just we dont like this policy but if you dont change this policy we may decide to kill youadvertisementstory continues below advertisementbut now we should worry about the display of weapons as a tool of protest moving from the rightwing fringes into the conservative mainstreamfor some time weapons display has been a means of identity signaling farright politicians such as rep lauren boebert rcolo or sen ted cruz rtex pose with guns to show theyre real rootin tootin conservatives other candidates air ads showing them popping off rounds to get the republican bases blood pumpingbut thats a performance meant for a broad audience who will see it through the media its not aimed at intimidating people occupying the same physical space as those politiciansaccording to the gun safety group giffords in more than 30 states openly carrying a handgun is legal while in 44 states its legal to openly carry a long gun the reason for the latter is that many laws were made when the only reason most anyone would carry a rifle is to go hunting but today those lax laws are exploited by people who get a thrill from walking into starbucks and terrorizing patrons with an ar15 slung across their backsadvertisementstory continues below advertisementand thats who were talking about insecure men almost always men desperate to feel the power their ordinary lives dont provide them so they can find something resembling manhood by inspiring fear by othersopinion what the rittenhouse trial tells us about race and vigilantismbut its even better if you can use the threat of murder to shut down the political speech of your opponents or multiply the effectiveness of your own mad at your congressman for his position on a new infrastructure bill you could paint a sign to hold up at a protest at his district office or you could just show up with an ar15 in your hand so he knows that you may decide to kill himthe supreme court recently heard a lawsuit against a new york state law that restricts peoples ability to take guns outside the home judging by the oral arguments the courts conservatives will almost certainly strike down that law and require every state to allow guns in waistbands holsters and pocketbooks every time you go out in public there will be a good chance some of the people around you will be armedadvertisementstory continues below advertisementgun advocates used to say that an armed society is a polite society by which they meant that we can all be forced into good behavior if we live in a state of constant terror knowing that even the most minor disagreement could result in murder the same horrific logic may soon be applied to political

wont be a leap for more and more conservatives to decide that carrying guns is an appealing tool of political action the thought is terrifying  which is exactly why theyre drawn to it",

            "clean_text": "wilmington del ap  a difficult political atmosphere for president joe biden may have become even more treacherous with the acquittal of kyle rittenhousebiden was already facing sliding poll numbers with an electorate worn down by the coronavirus pandemic and increasing inflation now the president finds himself caught between outraged democrats  some of whom were already stewing over bidens inability to land police reform and voting rights legislation  and republicans looking to use the rittenhouse case to exploit the national divide over matters of grievance and racethis is one of the last things biden wants to be engaging in at this moment as he tries to finish up the big build back better bill and get that across the finish line through the senate said christopher borick director of the muhlenberg college institute of public opinion race and kyle rittenhouse is not the space where he wants or needs to be going deep right nowadvertisementthe acquittal of rittenhouse has touched off new conversations about racial justice vigilantism and policing in america the illinois teen armed himself with an ar15style semiautomatic rifle during an august 2020 protest in kenosha wisconsin days after the shooting of a black man by a white police officer he said he came to small city to help protect a car lot from vandals and provide medical aidrittenhouse would end up fatally shooting two men and maiming a third rittenhouse and his lawyers successfully argued that he had acted in selfdefense during a confrontation in which he feared for his lifethe verdict in the case comes at a moment when biden is trying to keep fellow democrats focused on passing his massive social services and climate bill and hoping to turn the tide with americans who have soured on his performance as president the president responded carefully following fridays verdict expressing respect for the jurys decision he later added in a written statement that like many americans he was angry and concerned with the jury acquittal of rittenhouse meanwhile republicans who had success in this months virginia election in part by accusing democrats of promoting critical race theory in public schools are embracing 18yearold rittenhouse as their newest hero in americas culture wars gop reps paul gosar of arizona and matt gaetz of florida have said theyd like to hire him as an intern with gosar suggesting they arm wrestle for the honor another republican rep lauren boebert of colorado on saturday predicted that liberal outrage over the rittenhouse trial would benefit her partyit seems liberals want selfdefense to be illegal boebert tweeted try running on that in 2022 and see how far it gets you with the majority of the sane american publicformer president donald trump was quick to stand with rittenhouse following the verdict he called the teen brave for testifying in his own defense and accused the left of trying to fan hatred with its treatment of rittenhouseadvertisementtrump has spent much of his postpresidency stoking divisions with his frontal criticism of biden and of any republican who has not marched in lockstep with his views and most republicans either through silence or direct endorsement have followed his leadin the aftermath of the acquittal republicans have highlighted a tweet by biden during his winning 2020 presidential campaign in which he appeared to suggest that rittenhouse was a white supremacist the tweet from september 2020 excoriated trump for failing to disavow white supremacists on the debate stage the previous night and included a video that contained a still image of rittenhouse from the night of the kenosha shooting and footage of torchbearing white supremacists at the 2017 unite the right rally in charlottesville virginiasen tom cotton of arkansas and republican national committee chairwoman ronna mcdaniel are among party officials who have called on biden to apologizehe smeared a teenager to score political points and spread lies about this case mcdaniel wrote on twitter what biden did was dangerous and inflammatoryasked by a reporter soon after the verdict if he stood by his campaign social media posting biden responded that i stand by what the jury has concludedborick the muhlenberg college pollster said the results of this months elections in virginia show that driving at cultural issues  including race and transgender rights  could be a good strategy for republicans trying to energize a segment of the electorate that was passionate about trump but less enthusiastic about the rest of the gop but borick warned that the gops fulsome embrace of rittenhouse wasnt without riski dont know if its a great place to be if youre trying come the midterms to reach suburban voters and educated voters who might not fault the decision to acquit rittenhouse because of the circumstances but are far from comfortable holding him up as a hero borick saideven before the verdict biden had been facing increased pressure from some democrats over the lack of progress on passing voting rights and police reform legislationlast month a day after senate republicans filibustered a major voting bill for the second time this year biden acknowledged that the process of governing could be frustrating and sometimes dispiriting but urged supporters to keep the faithat the same civil rights leaders have expressed frustration that biden has not used the power of the bully pulpit more to push for a broad police reform bill named after george floyd the black minneapolis man whose killing last year by police touched off protests around the usspeaking at an event earlier this week where he signed into law a trio of bills to increase aid to police biden only made passing mention of the george floyd act asking legislators from both parties to work together to make it lawthats next biden saidfind aps full coverage on the trial of kyle rittenhouse
